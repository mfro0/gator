   A viewer for TV capable cards.
   
          * Xv support
	  
   Requirements: TV input capable card with Xv support, Tcl/Tk 8.3.x or 
                 later. 
		  
	
*** NOTES ***

       * right-clicking in the video window will bring up a menu
       
       * People with newer cards with SPDIF - if your sound is distorted
         try muting/unmuting various channels (like CD).
	 LET ME KNOW (volodya@mindspring.com) if this helps.       

       * If you are working off ffmpeg CVS it is a good idea to run
         
	 make clean; cvs update -d; make 

	 in ffmpeg directory before installing newer version of avview. 
	 Since CVS might turn out to be screwed up I recommend making a 
	 tarball of ffmpeg tree right after make clean - it is not that 
	 big and you would be able to untar it and continue as before if 
	 anything breaks.
