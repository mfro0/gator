   A viewer for TV capable cards.
   
          * Xv support
	  
   Requirements: TV input capable card with Xv support, Tcl/Tk 8.3.x or 
                 later. 
		  
*** INSTALLATION ****

Get ffmpeg tarball corresponding to this version of AVview from http://gatos.sf.net/
If you are compiling from CVS get the latest ffmpeg tarball from http://gatos.sf.net/

Get ALSA libraries/drivers from http://www.alsa-project.org/ - latest 0.9.x.

If you downloaded this code from CVS run the following command first:

        autoconf   (you need version 2.52 or later)
      
Next run

	./configure
	make
	
*** NOTES ***

       * right-clicking in the video window will bring up a menu
       * People with newer cards with SPDIF - if your sound is distorted
         try muting/unmuting various channels (like CD).
	 LET ME KNOW (volodya@mindspring.com) if this helps.       
       * since we are working off ffmpeg CVS it is a good idea to 
         run make clean; cvs update -d; make ; in ffmpeg directory
	 before installing newer version of avview. Since CVS might turn
	 out to be screwed up I recommend making a tarbal of ffmpeg tree
	 right after make clean - it is not that big and you would be able
	 to untar it and continue as before if anything breaks.
