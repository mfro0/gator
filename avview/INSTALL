			*** INSTALLATION ****

Requirements:
	Tcl/Tk 8.4
	libzvbi 0.2.3 (http://zapping.sf.net/)
	Alsa 1.0.0 drivers and library (optional) (http://www.alsa-project.org/)
	FFmpeg 0.4.8 (optional, http://ffmpeg.sf.net/)
	autoconf 2.57 or later (if compiling from CVS) (http://www.gnu.org/)
	automake 1.7.8 (if compiling from CVS) (http://www.gnu.org)
	LIRC 0.6.0 or later (optional, http://www.lirc.org/)
	
To compile:

	./configure --with-ffmpeg=/path/to/compiled/ffmpeg/tree
	make
	
Note: I mean *** compiled *** ffmpeg tree, i.e. the where you compiled ffmpeg, 
not where you installed. it. AVview does not rely on installed ffmpeg binaries.

If you are using code from CVS you need to run these commands first:

	autoconf
	autoheader
	automake

To install:
	make install
	
You can now run avview with the command:
	start_avview
	
If you would like to run avview without installing it use command:
	./start_avview.no_install
	
Notes:

	* if README or INSTALL files have been updated during your last
	  CVS checkout make will ask you to review them

	* make install will copy a KDE desktop file start_avview.desktop
	  to avview shared files directory (usually /usr/local/share/AVview).
	  You can link (or copy) this file to your Desktop (or any other place)
	  to be able to start AVview with a click of a mouse. 
	  
	  This file has hardcoded paths (computed during compile) so there is
	  no need to copy icons or edit anything.
