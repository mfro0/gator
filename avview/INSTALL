			*** INSTALLATION ****

Requirements:
	Tcl/Tk 8.3
	Alsa 0.9.0 drivers and library (optional) (http://www.alsa-project.org/)
	FFmpeg tarball (optional)
	autoconf 2.52 or later (if compiling from CVS) (http://www.gnu.org/)
	automake 1.6.3 (if compiling from CVS) (http://www.gnu.org)
	
To compile:

	./configure --with-ffmpeg=/path/to/compiled/ffmpeg/tree
	make
	
If you are using code from CVS you need to run these commands first:

	autoconf
	autoheader
	automake

To install:
	make install
	
You can now run avview with the command:
	start_avview
	
If you would like to run avview without installing it use command:
	./start_avview.no_install
	
Notes:

	* if README or INSTALL files have been updated during your last
	  CVS checkout make will ask you to review them

	* make install will copy a KDE desktop file start_avview.desktop
	  to avview shared files directory (usually /usr/local/share/AVview).
	  You can link (or copy) this file to your Desktop (or any other place)
	  to be able to start AVview with a click of a mouse. 
	  
	  This file has hardcoded paths (computed during compile) so there is
	  no need to copy icons or edit anything.
