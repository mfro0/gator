 * A few important notes on some of the I/O statements provided:
 *
 * inl/outl     32-bit R/W through PIO space.  The register is specified as the
 *              actual PIO address.  These are actually defined in compiler.h.
 *
 * inw/outw     16-bit counterparts to inl/outl.  Not used for Mach64 support.
 *
 * inb/outb     8-bit counterparts to inl/outl.
 *
 * inm/outm     32-bit R/W through MMIO space.  The register is specified as
 *              the actual MMIO offset (with Block 1 following Block 0), which,
 *              in this case, is equivalent to the register's IOPortTag from
 *              atiregs.h.  Can be used for those few non-FIFO'ed registers
 *              outside of Block 0's first 256 bytes.  inm() can also be used
 *              for FIFO'ed registers if, and only if, it can be guaranteed to
 *              not have been previously FIFO'ed (e.g. when the engine is
 *              idle).  pATI->pBlock array elements must have been previously
 *              set up by ATIMapApertures().
 *
 * outf         32-bit write through MMIO cache.  Identical to outm() but
 *              intended for FIFO'ed registers.  There is no inf() provided.
 *
 * inr/outr     32-bit R/W through PIO or MMIO.  Which one depends on the
 *              machine architecture.  The register is specified as a IOPortTag
 *              from atiregs.h.  Can only be used for registers in the first
 *              256 bytes of MMIO space (in Block 0).  Note that all of these
 *              registers are non-FIFO'ed.
 *
 * in8/out8     8-bit counterparts to inr/outr.
 *
 * For portability reasons, inr/outr/in8/out8 should be used in preference to
 * inl/outl/inb/outb to/from any register space starting with CRTC_H_TOTAL_DISP
 * but before DST_OFF_PITCH (in the order defined by atiregs.h).  None of
 * inm/outm/outf should ever be used for these registers.
 *
 * outf()'s should be grouped together as much as possible, while respecting
 * any ordering constraints the engine might impose.  Groups larger than 16
 * outf()'s should be split up into two or more groups as needed (but not
 * necessarily wanted).  The outf() groups that result should be immediately
 * preceeded by an ATIMach64WaitForFIFO(n) call, where "n" is the number of
 * outf()'s in the group with the exception that groups containing a single
 * outf() should not be thus preceeded.  This means "n" should not be less than
 * 2, nor larger than 16.
 */
 
/* few more notes ;) - V.D.

From Marc:
- ... for reasons of portability to other architectures, all I/O to registers
  starting with CRTC_H_TOTAL_DISP but before DST_OFF_PITCH (in the order
  defined by atiregs.h) should be done with inr()/outr() instead.  All
  remaining <snip> with outf()'s and grouped together as much as possible while
  respecting any ordering constraints the engine might have.  The outf()
  groups that result (other than those with only one outf()) should be
  immediately preceded by an ATIMach64WaitForFIFO(n) call, where "n" is
  the number of outf()'s that follow.  "n" should never be greater than
  16, nor less than 2.  This code should also ensure the engine is idle
  before executing any of the remaining inm()'s.
