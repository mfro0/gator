The LIRC driver has now been integrated into LIRC-CVS (7.x).  Please download
the latest version of LIRC.

Be sure to run irrecord to generate a new configuration file.  The X10 remotes
support 16 channels, thus there are 16 possible codes for each button.  The
sample configuration only contains codes for one remote channel.
