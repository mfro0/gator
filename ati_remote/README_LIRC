lirc_usb.c:

The LIRC driver is a hack between the GATOS ATI remote driver and another
LIRC usb driver.  Currently, it creates a device file (/dev/usb/remote0)
and LIRC must be told to access that device via command line.  I've tested
it with LIRC version 0.6.6 successfully.

This driver is a temporary solution.  I am working towards a LIRC driver
that uses their new driver interface (lirc_dev) and will eventually be
included with LIRC, not GATOS.

Anyhow, to install it:

Since I haven't messed with GNU's build tools, this is very half-assed...

1) Download LIRC source and run ./autogen.sh; ./configure
2) Copy the lirc_usb.c source over another driver's source
3) Run make in that driver's source directory
4) Rename driver to lirc_usb.o
5) Copy to /lib/modules/(kernel version)/misc
6) Run depmod -a
7) Run insmod lirc_usb debug=1
8) Run lircd -d /dev/usb/remote0

Good luck!
