     ATI USB Remote Control driver
     
     This is experimental driver.. who knows what it'll do ?
     
     To use:
     
         * turn on USB and "input" support in the kernel
	 * make
	 * make test
	 * configure X to use /devfs/input/mice as a mouse
	 * start X - enjoy !
	 
     loading module like this:
     
     insmod ati_remote channel_mask=16
     
     will tell ati_remote to ignore signals coming from remote controls
     transmitting on channel 4 (16=2^4). To mask out more channels just
     add 2^channel_number values. Default is 0 (respond to all channels).
     
     You can change the channel by pressing and holding the hand icon until
     it starts to blink. When it stops input channel code (from 1 to 16)
     and press hand icon again.
