    USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !
    
    This is an experimental driver.. who knows what it'll do ;)
    
hints:

    * edit Makefile 
    * compile
    * become root and issue "make test"
    * start X
    * get AVview, compile it
    * run AVview
    * enjoy
    * tweak

Additional notes:

    1) I guess I should have put this into README:

        the way km works is this:

        * you setup TV-in using AVview and Xserver - which means
          you see TV in a window.

        * now you can use km to see video data. When an application
          opens /dev/videoXXX created by km the code check to see
          whether AIW card is receiving data from the decoder.
          If this is true km sets up DMA transfers to deliver data
          into main RAM. If not it reports -ENODATA.

    2) So, to use xv_stream you need _two_ networked computers: one with
       AVview running and another to put xv_stream window on. The result
       is that you should see more or less the same TV image in both
       windows. Displaying both on the same screen will not work as
       ATI cards have only one overlay scaler unit and both xawtv and
       xv_stream need it.

    3) what can you do if you have one computer ? Get AVview and 
       matching version of ffmpeg off GATOS website on Sourceforge 
       and capture snapshots and streams with AVview. 
       
       You can view them later with xine, for example.
       
    4) you cannot use this module simultaneously with Linux framebuffer devices.
       (More precisely your mileage will vary.. I have not tried this for a long
        time)

    5) you need Linux 2.4.20 (or later) to compile it properly
       
    6) You might (will !) have problems if you don't let your BIOS assign an 
       irq to your video card.
